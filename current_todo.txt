## CURRENT TODO LIST ##

overall:
    - continue to conduct product fit interviews
    - reach out to professors with large intro classes, try and get their
      opinions on the idea in general / usability

frontend: 
    - begin mockups for user interface (figma, hand-drawn, whatever)
        - consider how video vs. text oriented learning would change the
          mockup page view
    - react (bootstrap, nodejs)  
    - class vs user oriented interface? 
    - high level explanations of other classes / being able to view the pages 
    for classes that you're not in
    - website fully open? open to columbia / non-columbia students?
        - drawbacks of fully open: people less inclined to make videos

backend:
    - construct database for holding the following information within
      schema: 
        - links to videos that explain concepts
            - links to youtube videos that are hosted by youtube, not us
        - login information (username,password,cookie cache,etc.)
        - ranking system(?) 
            - this is the most nebulous at the moment, but could be as
              simple as a points-based system (i.e. +10 points for sharing a
              video) 
        - class schedule information uploaded by user

data science:
    - user feedback metrics / gauging how people are learning and what they need help with 
    - repetitive questions (TAs always asked the same thing) 
        - aggregation? FAQs? 

implementation:
    - knowing that the success of our website relies on engagement from
      users, study user engagement strategies  
    - what times are other ed-tech resources utilized most heavily? piazza? 
        - would we expect the majority of our users to only engage prior to
          midterms / finals? 


GOALS: 
    - backend:
        - alice and marcus pick a DBMS system, outline but don't implement database
        for example: 

        DATA TABLES:
        
        CREATE TABLE login (
            uni VARCHAR(10)
            ); 

    - frontend:
        - meet with nikhilesh, chenoa, ian
            - finalize user interface ideas

    - everyone: 
        - continue reaching out to students, TAs, Profs about idea in general

    - implementation:
        - continue working on interviews
        - look at potential competitors' designs (ones with greater degree of 
        proximity than piazza, courseworks)
