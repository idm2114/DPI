## CURRENT TODO LIST ##

overall:
    - continue to conduct product fit interviews
    - reach out to professors with large intro classes, try and get their
      opinions on the idea in general / usability

frontend: 
    - begin mockups for user interface (figma, hand-drawn, whatever)
        - consider how video vs. text oriented learning would change the
          mockup page view
    - 

backend:
    - construct database for holding the following information within
      schema: 
        - links to videos that explain concepts
        - login information (username,password,cookie cache,etc.)
        - ranking system(?) 
            - this is the most nebulous at the moment, but could be as
              simple as a points-based system (i.e. +10 points for sharing a
              video) 
        - class schedule information uploaded by user

data science:

implementation:
    - knowing that the success of our website relies on engagement from
      users, study user engagement strategies  
    - what times are other ed-tech resources utilized most heavily? piazza? 
        - would we expect the majority of our users to only engage prior to
          midterms / finals?
