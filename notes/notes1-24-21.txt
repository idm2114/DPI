********* RECAP LAST WEEK *********

********* CLASSES TO TARGET *********
- middle level classes may be more viable than intro level classes
  - econometrics, AP, intro to electrical engineering?
  - piazza for econometrics: really bad as compared to other classes
    - has unanswered questions
    - not currently very usable

********* WORKING WITH PROFESSORS **********
- which professors would be good? 
  - those who are most amenable 
  - for now, plan on working without professor's help -- want to develop a
    viable product prior to pitching the idea

********* NEXT STEPS **********
- follow up with stan liao for facebook -- colubmia confessions access
- ian: create nltk folder for AP emails and send it to elisa 
- alice: work on creating an entity-relationship diagram of database
  structure on lucidchart
- joe: make list of econometrics ideas that are difficult / challenging for
  students, cross reference with list of pre-reqs 
- nik: work on react front-end (want to develop a login page by the end of
  this week)
- elisa: try and save all AP emails into nltk folder
  - want to look through AP emails to find commonalities in terms of email
    subjects and labs / concepts that students struggle with the most

- adding new members to team? 
  - data science: pretty okay with 2 members right now
  - implementation: would be nice to have someone else
  - back end: would be nice to have someone else  
  - front end: would be nice to have someone else
