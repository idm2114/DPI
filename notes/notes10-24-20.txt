********* RECAP LAST WEEK *********

- Did introductions, talked about project ideas mentioned last time 

********* PROJECT IDEAS **********

- Schedule meetings across different time zones to account for differences
- Implementation side: reach out to people to see what currently 
bothers them about online learning / how we could help
- From a data perspective, should think about how many inputs we need
to effectively model and build our algorithm
    - keeping in mind if we are allowed to access some data
- Having 3-4 different platforms for registering (SSOL, Vergil, CULPA) makes
things difficult to keep track of 

********* TIME ZONE CONVERTER  **********

- Automatically convert time zone to the recepients' local time
- How do we see this being implemented? 
- Time zone conversion during emails, text messages?
- Chrome extension?
    - change link to meeting link automatically? 
    - text highlighting? show conversion on hover?
- throw warning to user when recepients' local time doesn't make sense (i.e.3am)

********* ANNOYING THINGS ON THE INTERNET **********

- always having to download files on courseworks
- switch between windows continuously for columbia homework
- way to display multiple documents at once or flip through them easilyi
- would be really nice to zip together and automatically download files
for a single / for all classes
- tons of tabs open on chrome (tab management system?) 
    - what would this look like? chrome extension?
    - losing track of information you know you had is infuriating
    - highlighting and markup on websites
- courseworks / piazza summaries don't show answers / grades, only notifications
- autofill job applications? workday? 
    - obvious problems with storing users passwords / encryption and security
- can't engage with events because they are hard to find / hidden in emails
    - would be nice to have a centralized place for them
- be able to meet people from columbia
    - before/after class interactions and bumpbing into people virtually obsolete
    - did you catch my pun?
