- everyone is looking for something practical
- find the longest substring in a string? reverse linked list? the possibilities
are boundless!

- many classes are too theory-focused
- people feel as though the skillsets they develop in classrooms don't translate
  to real world problems (on coding interviews, etc)


- build something that we would actually want to use 
- learn from each other

********* PROJECT IDEAS **********

- COVID-oriented population density tracker on campus (live?) 
    - questions about implementation: could look at wifi networks for cell data

- Online marketplace for businesses with diverse owners
    - Is this transferrable to Columbia

********* CURRENT PROBLEMS **********

- Feels inconvenient to chat with classmates during class
    - Very difficult to meet people on Zoom
    - not able to connect with other people in your classes 
    - everyone has their camera off
    - hard to figure out if you know anyone in your class

- TA help rooms
    - places for people to help each other along with TAs 
    - currently nonexistent in the online format

- Vergil is awful (syllabi always missing, faculty reviews incorrect)
    - algorithm that tailors class suggestions based on previous classes taken,
    quality of professors available that semester, etc.

- Extending lunch with professors into the virtual space? 
    - apparently a violation of university fund spending

********* MEETING PEOPLE AS A FRESHMAN **********

- don't get to meet people outside of zoom classes often 
- professors for some classes place people into breakout rooms to introduce
  themselves, talk about problem sets
- primarily academically oriented questions
- don't often discuss personal interests / life
    - HOW CAN WE CHANGE THIS? 

- time zone difference is very inconvenient
- difficult to figure out what one person's "sunday morning" means in a
  different time zone
