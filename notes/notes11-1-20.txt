********* RECAP LAST WEEK *********

- Did introductions, talked about project ideas mentioned last time 

********* PROJECT IDEAS **********

- Nikhilesh and Alice: 
    - freshmen have a hard time meeting new people 
    - feel alienated in some respects from the Columbia community at large
    - NSOP friends haven't really stuck... friendships only formed around study
    groups
    - known need: people want to find new people with like interests and meet
    others 
    - tinder for friends? 
    - based on survey that was sent out, 75% of freshmen say they don't know 
    enough people at Columbia
    - 40% say they don't talk to their Columbia friends they've meet online
    - would it be more successful to match people randomly or allow them 
    to choose to meet each other? 
    - joe: one issue with meeting new people is the intimidating aspect of
    making the first move, there should be some forced element that matches
    them (akin to a nudge)
        - could we gamify it?  
    - provide conversation starters?
    - currently, people only socialize around classes 
    - zoom is currently the best of the worst options
    - one on one vs group meetings? 
    - ian: one problem is that people struggle to think about themselves and 
    bond in 2020, questions like "how are you" or "what do you do for fun" 
    become loaded
    - marcus: forced interactions should be more than one on one, less than 5
        - inverse correlation between num people and chattiness
    - could provide conversation starters at random intervals if we detect
    a lull in texting 
    - could provide an initial survey to filter sort people into groups 
        - people who are super productive in quarantine, people who are sad,
        people who worked out, people who haven't, etc.
        - goal is to find a connection that people can bond over 
    - verging into the realm of social engineering :/
    - key problems;
        - how do we decide to match people together?
            - match on tangible factors? 
    - if prompted to join, would people actually sign up?
    - among us as an example of a game that also facilitates social interaction
    - joe: if we're gonna do it, we should try and build-test by next semester
        - people most willing to try new things at the start of new semesters
    - need to be incentivized to get involved
    - making friends is low probability of success in the online world 
    - issue of timing or general disinterest in the app? 
        - concensus opinion that timing is very important in terms of deployment

********* NSOP ONLINE: ALICE"S PERSPECTIVE **********

- don't really feel like you're part of a big event or induction into college
- don't feel like you're in college
    - if you wanted to feel like you were actually in college, you would have
    to fit into the mold of the college life you envisioned 
    - not feeling like you're part of the bigger group
        - if you're part of a group and something is happening, you can feel
        it happening for the group
        - sense of isolation around what would otherwise be group-oriented events

********* NEXT STEPS **********

- find a way to validate the need for this project 
- reaching out to people in person, discussing and getting their opinions
    - google forms is not enough; talking to people is significantly better
- zoom calls with freshmen, understand their situation 
- personal interviews as a more insightful way of getting feedback
- target group is for sure freshmen
- leaving things more open ended 
- is the timeline too slow? viable life for the app beyond covid? 
- mentorship between underclassmen and upperclassmen?
- tangible next step: post in FB Class of 2024 group to try and interview freshmen
about their experiences with Columbia so far
